The problem is converting images of handwritten text to computer text. Existing handwriting transcription solutions are expensive and do not offer a method of uploading your own images to be translated. The aspects which will make my solution unique is to make it accessible to the general public and to upload images of handwriting to the website. I will be measuring accuracy and plausibility. Plausibility can be measured through finding the number of existing words or finding how many edits it takes to transformed the projecting outcome into an existing word. The final deliverable will be a website and a Github repository. The website will allow for the user to upload images of handwritten text to be converted into computerized text and will output the text in consideration with new lines.
